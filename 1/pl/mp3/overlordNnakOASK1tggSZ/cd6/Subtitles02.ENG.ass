Dialogue: 0,0:04:46.60,0:04:52.08,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,That’s because the other Guardians do work for you too, Ainz-sama.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:52.08,0:04:56.01,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,It would be strange if I was the only one who received a reward.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:56.01,0:05:04.08,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,That, that’s right, if Albedo-san or Shalltear-san learned that onee-chan was the only one who got a reward, then...
Dialogue: 0,0:05:04.41,0:05:08.68,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,{\i1}Indeed... that would be very bad.

Dialogue: 0,0:08:05.30,0:08:07.98,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,Explaining in detail would take too long, but in short,
Dialogue: 0,0:08:07.98,0:08:14.51,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,these “companies” provided free services known as fringe benefits to ensure their members could work comfortably.

Dialogue: 0,0:08:28.04,0:08:36.38,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,Indeed. For starters, I wish to construct the facilities that we will need in Nazarick.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:36.38,0:08:42.88,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,I would like to improve the livability of Nazarick and the relationships between us.

Dialogue: 0,0:08:49.68,0:08:54.90,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,but is Nazarick not amply furnished with all the facilities we need?
